        We add display:flex to the container, in order to manipulate its items/children, which become flex items.
        justify-content: center ==> same without flex, with 'margin: 0 auto;' set on the container.

        Flex-shrink only ends up being applied if the size of all flex items is larger than their parent container.
        Use: 'flex:initial;' when you don't want a flex item to inherit from the parent's 'flex:1;' for example.

        An important implication to notice here is that when you specify flex-grow or flex-shrink, flex items do not necessarily respect your given values for width.
        Default= flex: 0 1 auto;
        flex: [flex-grow] [flex-shrink] [flex-basis]; === flex: [max] [min] [ideal size];

        To make the 3 child elements of a flex div grow, there are a few ways:
        Set the width: 100% or set the flex-basis; 100% or flex-grow: 1;

        Main axis & cross axis

        Height: 100% is given to the parent
